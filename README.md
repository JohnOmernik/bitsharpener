# Bit Sharpener - A place for Drill User Contributions
---
This repository is designed to be a centralized hub for UDFS, storage plugins, and other user created add-ons to drill. The goal here is to have some level of process, testing, and description around the UDFs so that they can easily be build and used by non-programming users of Drill.  This does not guarantee their efficacy, please test in your environment.
